# Managing Python Environment

To manage a virtual Python environment and install pip dependencies, I recommend using pyenv. pyenv allows you to switch between different versions of Python and create isolated virtual environments for your projects.

Installation Guide:

You can follow the installation guide provided in the pyenv repository on GitHub: [pyenv Installation Guide](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

The reason why I used pyenv is because I can set it up to automatically activate/deactivate python virtual environment when `cd` into the project.

# Installing required dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
